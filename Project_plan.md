# Project plan

## Description

I am planing to build my favorities movies web app.
I wil use <https://api.themoviedb.org/> (checked the api before) api for taking latest movies.
In this web app people can see latest films. In de left side bar person can see categories. In this right side, person can see bookmarked movies.
With movies card, person can bookmark and buy. Buy meaning, he/she has to go external website for buying film.
With search button, person can search films.
Here is the coding structure.

## Futures
