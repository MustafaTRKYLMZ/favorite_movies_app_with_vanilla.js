# My Favorite movies web app with vanilla.js

My favorite movies web app is about the latest films. You can see which film was released and which one is popular.
I build my favorites movies web app.
I used <https://api.themoviedb.org/> api for taking latest movies.
In this web app people can see latest films. In de left sidebar person can see categories. In this right side, person can see bookmarked movies.
With movies card, person can bookmark.
With search button, person can search films.
